# Example configuration file for Google Earth Tile Generator
#
# Usage:
#   google-earth-tiles download example-config.yaml
#
# Or with verbose output:
#   google-earth-tiles download example-config.yaml -v
#
# To list available layers:
#   google-earth-tiles list-layers

# Geographic extent (bounding box in WGS84 coordinates)
# This example covers a small area in Hokkaido, Japan
# Coordinates correspond to: https://www.google.com/maps/@43.6693912,142.858222,12.49z
extent:
  min_lon: 142.858  # West boundary
  min_lat: 43.669   # South boundary
  max_lon: 142.862  # East boundary
  max_lat: 43.671   # North boundary

# Zoom level (tile resolution)
# Higher zoom = more detail but more tiles to download
#
# Valid ranges by layer:
#   std (Standard Map):              2-18
#   pale (Pale Map):                 2-18
#   english (English Map):           5-8
#   ort (Orthographic Aerial):       2-18
#   relief (Color-Coded Elevation):  5-15
#   seamlessphoto (Seamless Aerial): 2-18
#
# When multiple layers are selected, the valid range is the intersection.
# If zoom is outside the valid range, it will be automatically clamped.
#
# Example zoom levels:
#   2-8:   Country/regional scale
#   9-12:  City scale
#   13-15: Neighborhood scale
#   16-18: Street/building scale
zoom: 14
